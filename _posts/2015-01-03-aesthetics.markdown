On the subject of Form vs. Function (e.i. how something is looks vs. how something operates), I will shamelessly admit that I favoured Form over Function, to the point where Function followed Form (which is the opposite of what should occur). This favour lasted virtually the entirety of my post-graduate studies. It likely came from my primal background of fine art. On top of that, I was unexposed to the real world, and thus unaware of the immense weight of Function. Of course, that has all since changed and I am now interested in the balance of the two — as any designer should be. 

Here’s where the header comes in: So much as something can and will function, does it it require a certain degree of aesthetic to maximize it’s function-ability? I think it’s obvious, yes.  The question is how much? With the need for unpolished designs (e.g. for iteration focused startups, early business development), how little can we put into the form of the function and still attain a high of function value. Mind you, my goal is not to establish a languid design standard in any way. Instead, I am interested in determining the impact of reasonably minimal Form in relation to relatively Form-free functions. This has been on my mind for a while.

As an aside: the result of this impact may be simply caused by the engagement of our senses (visual), as opposed to being left solely with the “unnatural” task of assessing complex ideas solely with our imagination. Additionally, I would argue that reasonably minimal aesthetic (vs. relatively no aesthetic) would aid in convincing your peers, investors, and alike in accepting your ideas. It’s like selling a product and the Aesthetic is the packaging. It isn’t necessary to the actual product but it does help a great deal. 

The real task becomes measuring the impact of aesthetics and seeing where you’ll get the best IOR ratio.
